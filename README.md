## 📝 Project Overview
This project aims to automate the process of pollen grain classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It provides a simple and interactive Flask-based web interface where users can upload microscopic images of pollen grains, and the trained model predicts their type accurately.

## 💡 Key Features
🔍 Image classification using a deep learning CNN model

🖼️ Real-time image upload and prediction via Flask web app

📊 Preprocessed dataset of microscopic pollen images

💾 Saved model (.h5) for instant predictions

📱 Responsive and user-friendly UI

🎥 Output video demo for easy understanding

 ## Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras – for CNN model creation

OpenCV / PIL – for image processing

Flask – for the web interface

HTML, CSS – frontend design
