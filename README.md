# Pollen Profiling: Automated Classification of Pollen Grains

This project focuses on the automatic classification of pollen grains using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It includes a simple web-based user interface developed using Flask, allowing users to upload an image of a pollen grain and receive a prediction of its class.

##  Overview

Pollen grains are microscopic and vary in shape, size, and texture. Manual classification is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This project aims to automate the process using machine learning, specifically a deep learning-based image classifier.

## 🌟 Features

- Image classification using a trained CNN model.
- Easy-to-use web interface built with Flask.
- Upload pollen grain images and view instant predictions.
- Minimal dataset used for demonstration purposes.
- Modular code: easily upgradable with a larger dataset or deeper model.

## 🗂️ Dataset Summary

This demo uses a small, custom dataset with three categories of floral pollen images:
- **Daisy**  
- **Sunflower**  
- **Rose**

Each class contains 10 sample images for testing and demonstration. The dataset can be extended with microscopic real-world images for better results.

## 📌 Note

This is a demonstration-level project designed to show the feasibility of pollen grain classification using deep learning and to demonstrate integration with a web interface. It can be extended to more classes and trained with real microscopic datasets for production use.
